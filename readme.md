# Simple roguelike on Rust
My implementation of [rogulike in Rust](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html) featuring:
* Modular project system

New enum KnownSpell, with Display implemented.

## Controls
* Arrows - movement
* G - pick up item
* I - inventory
* S - spells

* Esc - exit
* Hover mouse over object in FOV to see what it is!
